# Upgrading from MSAL Angular v2 to v3

MSAL Angular v3 brings our Angular wrapper up-to-date with the latest version of MSAL common, and with out-of-the-box support for Angular 15 and rxjs 7.

This guide will demonstrate changes needed to migrate an existing application from `@azure/msal-angular` v2 to v3. 

If you are migrating from `@azure/msal-angular` v1, please refer to the [v1-v2 migration guide](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-angular/docs/v2-docs/v1-v2-upgrade-guide.md) first to migrate to MSAL v2.

Please also see the [MSAL Browser Migration Doc](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-browser/docs/v2-migration.md) for browser support and other key changes.

## Breaking changes in `@azure/msal-angular@3`

### Initialization

#### Applications using redirects

MSAL v3.x now requires initializing the application object. Initialization has been built into the `MsalRedirectComponent` and `handleRedirectObservable` API, and applications that have implemented redirect strategies do not have to make changes.

See the [guide to redirects](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-angular/docs/v2-docs/redirects.md) for details on handling redirects in your application.

#### Applications using popups

Due to initialization being built into `MsalRedirectComponent` and `handleRedirectObservable`, applications that only use popups will also have to either bootstrap the `MsalRedirectComponent` or call `handleRedirectObservable` manually once to initialize the application object. 

See the [guide to redirects](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-angular/docs/v2-docs/redirects.md) for set up details.

### The `allowNativeBroker` flag

The `allowNativeBroker` flag is now turned on by default in the configurations. If you're using a B2C authority you can turn it off as follows:

```js
export function MSALInstanceFactory(): IPublicClientApplication {
    return new PublicClientApplication({
        auth: {
            ...
        },
        cache: {
            ...
        },
        system: {
            allowNativeBroker: false, // Disables native brokering support
        }
    });
}
```

## Angular 15 and rxjs@7

MSAL Angular now expects that your application is built with `@angular/core@15`, `@angular/common@15`, `rxjs@7`. 

Due to this change, MSAL Angular v3 is not backwards compatible with earlier versions of Angular and RxJS and you may need to update your application. Please follow the [Angular Update Guide](https://update.angular.io/) to update your application to Angular 15.

As with MSAL Angular v2, `rxjs-compat` is not required.

## Documentation

Aside from the changes above, all MSAL Angular [v2 documentation](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-angular/docs/v2-docs) can also be used for MSAL Angular v3.

## Samples

We have put together a sample application for Angular 15. This sample demonstrates basic configuration and usage, and will be improved and added to incrementally. 

A sample for Angular 15 using B2C will be added shortly.

See [here](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/samples/msal-angular-v3-samples/README.md) for a list of the MSAL Angular v3 samples and the features demonstrated.
